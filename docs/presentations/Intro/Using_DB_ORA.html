# Motivation

![](imgs/process.png)

__Goal:__ Present options for streamlining analysis.

---

![](imgs/option1.png)

__Option 1:__

  1. Engage with SQL database to bypass GUI
  2. Processing queries based on geography and events
  3. Generate necessary data sets for working with SNA software 

---

# My Assumptions

  * Your organizations works with an RMS that is powered by an SQL database
  * You, or someone in your organization, are able to interface with your database (preferably in read-only mode)
  * You are somewhat familiar with SQL or are interested in learning
  * You know SNA and have experience putting together data sets for this type of analysis

---

# Meet our database

.pull-left[
![](imgs/sql-logo.png)
]
.pull-right[
Sample portable database (SQLite) with three tables:
  
  * `criminal_events`
  * `person_info`
  * `person_x_events`
]

&lt;/hr&gt;

__NOTE: The data presented hereafter is not real LE data, only dummy data meant to mimic the actual returns.__

&lt;/hr&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

.r-collapse-code[

```r
library(dplyr)
library(RSQLite)

con &lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(), "my-db.sqlite")
dbListTables(con)
```
]

# Streamlining Analyis in R

Sample network-level metrics:

Metric  | Explanation | Command
--------|-------------|---------
Density  | Number of observed ties divided by possible number of ties  | `edge_density()`
Average Degree  | Sum of ties divided by number of actors | `mean(degree())`
Global Clustering  | Sum of each actor's clustering divided by number of actors  | `transitivity()`

---

# Streamlining Network Analysis

Sample vertex-level metrics:

Metric  | Explanation | Command
--------|-------------|---------
Degree  | Count of actor's ties  | `degree()`
Eigenvector  | Weights an actor's centrality by the centrality of its neighbors  | `evcent()`
Closeness  | Average geodesic distance from an actor to another  | `closeness()`
Betweenness  | How often each actor lies on the shortest path between all other actors  | `betweenness()`
