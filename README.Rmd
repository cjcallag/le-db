## Background

This repository includes some of my examples on how to use OSS technologies with databases for network analysis. The goal here is to provide access to my slides, code, and notes.

If you have any questions or problems that you would need help with, please start an issue, [here](https://github.com/cjcallag/le-db/issues).

## Applications

The code for all applications can be found under the `inst` folder. However, if you are only looking for the Shiny GUI, you may find them:

  1. Simple Network Explorer, [here](https://callaghancorelab.shinyapps.io/simple_app/)
